<h1 align="center">Recipe Scraping Ingredient Compiler</h1>
<h2 align="center">Overview</h2>

<p align="center">A web scraping bot that compiles the ingredients from many online recipes and compiles the most common ingredients.</p>

<h2 align="center">Context</h2>

<p align="center">I, for one, love cooking with recipes. I have always been someone who likes breaking down problems and slowly completing them, and cooking with recipes gives me exactly that, along with a delicious result. The unfortunate thing is that with recipes, you generally need a group of specific ingredients, and those can vary wildly from recipe to recipe. My goal with this project is to compile a list of most common ingredients in a group of online recipes, so that users can have a good vision of what to buy on their next grocery shopping trip to give them the highest chance of being able to complete a wide variety of recipes.</p>

<h2 align="center">Proposed Solution</h2>

<p align="center">The way I plan to solve this problem is through web scraping the ingredients off these online recipes, and then cleaning up the data and doing some simple arithmetic to find the most common ingredients. I have chosen a Python library known as beautifulsoup4 to accomplish the task. I chose this library for a few reasons, but the most important one is that it is the simple and straightforward to pick up (of the various libraries I researched). There is not too much time to get through this project, so I chose ease of access with the library over amazing functionality, so that I could get it done fast.</p>

<h2 align="center">Timeline</h2>

<p align="center">Deadline – September 17th, 11:59PM</p>

<p align="center">By September 11th – Have Web Scraper Up and Running Where it Can Find All the Ingredients from a Single Recipe, Find a Website That I Can Easily Scrape From, Develop a Way to Scrape from a Mass Group of Recipes</p>

<p align="center">By September 12th – Clean Up Data so All Excess White Space and Symbols Are Removed</p>

<p align="center">By September 14th – Do Basic Computation With Data, Set up User Access So they Can See Results Easily</p>

<p align="center">By September 17th – Finishing Touches, Turn It In</p>
